# Postmortem Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the crucial process of postmortem in the tech industry, aiming to analyze and learn from system outages or failures. You'll be writing a postmortem based on a real or imaginary web stack issue.

## Concepts

### On-call

Any software system is prone to failure, and postmortems are a key tool to learn from mistakes and prevent future issues. The postmortem process has two main goals: informing the company about the outage's cause and ensuring that measures are taken to fix the root cause.

### Background Context
