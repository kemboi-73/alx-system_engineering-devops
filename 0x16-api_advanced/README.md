Reddit API Advanced
This project is designed to help you learn how to interact with APIs using the Reddit API as an example. You will be writing Python scripts to query the Reddit API and perform various tasks, such as getting the number of subscribers for a subreddit, printing the titles of the top 10 hot posts for a subreddit, and recursively retrieving all of the hot articles for a subreddit.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Read API documentation to find the endpoints you're looking for
Use an API with pagination
Parse JSON results from an API
Make a recursive API call
Sort a dictionary by value
Requirements
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Python 3.4.3
vi, vim, or emacs text editor
Requests library (install using pip3 install requests)
Tasks
How many subs? (mandatory) Write a function that queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should return 0.

Top Ten (mandatory) Write a function that queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit. If an invalid subreddit is given, the function should print None.

Recurse it! (mandatory) Write a recursive function that queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. If no results are found for the given subreddit, the function should return None.
