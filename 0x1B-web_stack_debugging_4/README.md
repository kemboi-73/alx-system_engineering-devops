Tasks
0. Sky is the limit, let's bring that limit higher
Description
Benchmarking using ApacheBench reveals a significant number of failed requests in the current web server setup with Nginx. The task is to analyze the output, identify the issues, and update the Puppet manifest (0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp) to fix the problems.

bash
Copy code
root@0a62aa706eb3:/# ab -c 100 -n 2000 localhost/
# Output and analysis provided in the task description.
root@0a62aa706eb3:/# puppet apply 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp
# Puppet manifest applied successfully.
1. User limit
Description
The task involves changing the OS configuration to enable logging in with the holberton user and opening a file without encountering error messages. The Puppet manifest (1-user_limit.pp) must be updated to achieve this.

bash
Copy code
root@079b7269ec1b:~# su - holberton
# Error messages displayed.
root@079b7269ec1b:~# puppet apply 1-user_limit.pp
# Puppet manifest applied successfully.
root@079b7269ec1b:~# su - holberton
# Successful login without error messages.
